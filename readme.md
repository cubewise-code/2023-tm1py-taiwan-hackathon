# Beginner Challenges

1. Read all leaf elements from the dimension: `Region`. print them out.
1. Add a new leaf elements: `Taiwan` to `Region`. Add it into the hierarchy
1. **Extra**: add `Bubble Tea` to the `Product` dimension. Include it in the Hierarchy
1. write new sales values to the `Sales` cube for `Lager` or `Bubble Tea` for `2021` `actuals` for `Taiwan`

# Medium Challenges

1. Read all actuals from 2021 _(Using MDX or a cube view)_ for a given product and region pair as a dataframe!
multiply the values in the dataframe with 1.1 and writes the data back to year 2022.
1. Build a separate script to clear forecast data for a given year, region and product (calling a bedrock process)
1. Build an end to end script that builds a `Food` dimension from the sharepoint file `popular_taiwan_dishes.csv`. You can find a script that reads the file sharepoint to CSV in the samples folder.
2. Load the dimension `Chips` from the Cloud instance to your TM1 instance
1. Now also load the attribute values for `Chips`. Make it faster!

# Hard Challenges

- Build a streamlit app with buttons and text fields that allow user to trigger the scripts you wrote in the sections above
- Add a cubewise logo to the streamlit app
- Add a navigation panel to the streamlit app
- Make it pretty. Be creative :)
